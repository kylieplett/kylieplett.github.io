<div class="column side" style="background-color:#EDB69E;"><p>About Me:</p>Hey guys! My name is Kylie Plett, and I'm a junior. I am Japanese, Thai and German. My birthday is June 14, 2003, meaning I am 16 years old. My favorite color is purple. Some of my favorite music artists are: Clairo, Cuco, Joji, Conan Gray, and mxmtoon. <p>My Hobbies:</p>I am part of the James Campbell Highschool marching band, and I play flute. I was also a part of the Hawaii All State Marching Band, performing in the Rose Parade, January 1, 2019. On the side, I work as a gymnastics coach, and I've been coaching for just over a year. Before then, I was a gymnast for 10 years.<p>Background:</p>I was Born in Okinawa, Japan, and I've moved around a lot since I was young, because my dad was in the military. I have lived in Japan, Virginia, Texas, Ohio, and here on Oahu. Cumulatively, I have lived on island majority of my life and I only moved to Ewa Beach earlier this year, due to my father's retirement. When I was little, I ived in the Pearl City/Aiea area, then I moved to the mainland, and when I came back I lived on Hickam. </div>
